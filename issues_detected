Possible issues/bugs that I would raise

1. Form allows user to skip 'namepage', where user is asked to give his name and surname.
It is possible not to fill those textfields, and continue to the next page.
solution: raise error when fields are empty, or filled incorrectly.

2. Form doesn't save users progress, as he moves towards end.
