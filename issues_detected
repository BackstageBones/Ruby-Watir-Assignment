Possible issues/bugs that I would raise

1. Form allows user to skip 'namepage', where user is asked to give his name and surname.
It is possible not to fill those textfields, and continue to the next page.
solution: raise error when fields are empty, or filled incorrectly.

2. The first form allows user to enter incorrect data such as special characters and numbers/
this should not be allowed and throw an alert. Also switching to next page with that data shouldn't be possible.


3. Form often loses date entered in the previous forms, especially when switching pages multiple times.

4. Date page allows user enter whichever date he likes, and doesn't throw an alert when wrong data entered.
For example user can enter 13 month of the year, which obviously doesn't exist.
The date can also be far from future, and it will work as long as followed by the rule of '-' separation between numbers.

5. Security question field takes all alphanumeric signs, including numbers and special characters.
Which is in my opinion, considered as a bug.
